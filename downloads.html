            <p>
                Sleepless Royale beta 1.0 Developer's Edition has been released.  NOTE FOR TESTERS: remember the vast scope of the "to-do" list and keep it simple for beta 1.0 testing.  Keep an eye for anything that obviously breaks the game.  Pay attention to what happens if you die from lava.  What's the next screen you see?  Were you a client or were you the server? etc.
                <br><br>
                Currently there are no weapon pickup sounds, but take a note of whether or not you hear any pickup sounds from the ammo or the health.  Also note whether you hear other players sounds.  I'm sure as of now all sounds might be client side only, unfortunately.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, everytime you get a kill the Killer is supposed to have a voiceover FX "Gitsome" but the Killed isn't supposed to hear it.  Does the Killed hear the Killer's taunt?
                <br><br>
                These are the main things I'm focused on.  If you notice anything else while testing please take a detailed note of it and try to reproduce it as well, then let me know.  Thanks for playing!!!
