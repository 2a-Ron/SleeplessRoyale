                Made some tweaks to the Join/Create Session logic that will hopefully make it easier to create or join a session.

                Last minute release!  Sorry for letting you all know to download devEdition02 then the night before coming out with devEdition03, but there were much needed tweaks.  The intro lobby time was set for editor testing which is way too short of a time period to get everyone in the game, so I had to extend it back to 120 seconds.
                <br><br>
                While I was at it, I multicast the weapon pickup FX along with the health pickup.  I also changed the pitch multiplier because it seemed to be making the FX sound like they were in slow motion.
                <br><br>

            <p>
                I released a second edition of the SR b1 dev copy with a few key changes.  The gunshots, ammo pickups, and footsteps have all been multicast so players within the range of hearing other players FX should now do so.
                <br><br>
                TESTERS please listen for sound duplicates!  Mainly do you hear your client gunshot AND the server replication of that sound on top of each other?  Also take note of the volume.  Eventhough the setting is way down at 0.2 it's possible it should go down even more

            <p>
                Sleepless Royale beta 1.0 Developer's Edition has been released.  NOTE FOR TESTERS: remember the vast scope of the "to-do" list and keep it simple for beta 1.0 testing.  Keep an eye for anything that obviously breaks the game.  Pay attention to what happens if you die from lava.  What's the next screen you see?  Were you a client or were you the server? etc.
                <br><br>
                Currently there are no weapon pickup sounds, but take a note of whether or not you hear any pickup sounds from the ammo or the health.  Also note whether you hear other players sounds.  I'm sure as of now all sounds might be client side only, unfortunately.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, everytime you get a kill the Killer is supposed to have a voiceover FX "Gitsome" but the Killed isn't supposed to hear it.  Does the Killed hear the Killer's taunt?
                <br><br>
                These are the main things I'm focused on.  If you notice anything else while testing please take a detailed note of it and try to reproduce it as well, then let me know.  Thanks for playing!!!
